- Fixed bugs with whispers for Drums of the Wild, Drums of Forgotten Kings and Runescroll of Fortitude.
- Mage Armor is now renamed to Molten Armor.
- When a buff such as Spirit or Fortitude or Mark of the Wild or drums are missing, RBS will now whisper someone at random who is in the same zone rather than just all who can buff it thus avoiding two Priests casting their raid-wide buff at the same time after both being whispered.

- Fixed bug with not quite handling multi-realm pug buffs right such as with Paladin aura.

- Fixed a missing aura warning when there are 3 Paladins.

Version 3.255 24th April 2010

Version 3.257 3rd May 2010

- Hopefully fixed the spamming of "Paladin has left the raid and had blessings assigned" when there is a Paladin in group 6-8 and those are ignored.
- Vigilance, Earth Shield, Focus Magic and Soul Stone now all show who cast them so you can deduce who is the slacking not having cast it.
- Zone check now always shows where the missing person is.

Version 3.258 4th May 2010
- Vigilance, Earth Shield, and Focus Magic will now announce the slackers who have not buffed it and also now only whisper those not having buffed it.
