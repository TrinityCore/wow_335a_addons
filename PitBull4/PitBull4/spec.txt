Each UnitID can have 0..* frames, not just 0..1

Definitions:
    classification: what kind of frame something is, also what settings it adheres to. e.g. player, party, raid, target, partypet
    singleton: a frame that is not part of a larger whole, e.g. player, pet, target, targettarget
    member: a frame that is part of a larget whole, e.g. raid1, party2pet
    supergroup: a set of members, e.g. raid, partypet
    group: a specific set of members, e.g. raid group 1, party members. All supergroups are made up of 1 or more groups.
    wacky: Whether a unit frame receives standard Blizzard events for UNIT_HEALTH and such. player, target, pet, focus, mouseover, party, partypet, and raid receive such events.
