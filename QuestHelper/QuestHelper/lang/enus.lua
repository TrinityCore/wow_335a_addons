  SYNTAX REFERENCE
  
  All '%' characters mark the position where some text is to be inserted.
  
  Following this character is some alphabetical text controlling how the data is
  to be interpreted, which may be empty.
  
  Following that is either a number, the index to the data to insert, or
  brackets containing some text to transform, which may recursively contain
  other transformed text.
  
  Examples:
    %1
      Inserts first argument into string without changing it.
    
    %h1
      Inserts first argument into string and highlights it.
    
    %(Hello World)
      Inserts the text 'Hello World' into the string. Not entirely useful,
      as you could simply just write 'Hello World'.
    
    %h(Hello World)
      Inserts the text 'Hello World', highlighted so that it stands out.
    
    %h(%q(%(cla)%(ss)))
      This convoluted example demonstrates nesting.
      First 'cla' and 'ss' are converted into 'class', this is made
      quoted, converting it into '"classes"', and then this is highlighted.
  
  Transformations:
    
    h
      Highlight some text. Bewarned that highlighting already highlighted text
      doesn't work as expected.
    
    t
      Insert a time, argument is interpreted as a number representing seconds.
    
    p
      Insert a percentage. Argument should be a number between 0 and 1, text
      will be shaded from red at 0% to green at 100%.
    
    q
      Quotes some text.
    
    Q
      Inserts a Lua quoted and escaped string.
  
  These transformations can made to do different things depending on the locale,
  if you're translating and need something changed, please ask.
