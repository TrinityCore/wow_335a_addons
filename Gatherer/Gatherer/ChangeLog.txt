# Changes:

- Fixed some checkboxes positions and edit boxes size in the Globals tabs
- Fixed default icon for worldmap notes to prevent spam in FrameXML.log
- Fixed Event processing not to occur while zoning.

- Quick fix for fishing to prevent recording on some silithus mobs.

# Changes:

# New:

  * First recording method, uses Trunks and Bloated fish to automatically record where you stand (type assigned to Floating wreck, even though it's not always true).
  * Second record method, uses the node tooltip, in order to do that, you must autoloot (shift click the bobber) AND move slightly the cursor to make the node tooltip appear.
  Fishing categories are: School (all type of school node), Floating Wreckage (include Oil Spill) and Elemental water.

2.2.1:
======
# Bug Fix:

- added dark iron to gatherable items (for WoW 1.7.0, icon courtesy of ksmith22, possibly missing french text).

# Bug Fix:
- world map filters display option value taken into account at logon

# Localization:
- French region table updated for new zone order in 1.6.0, translation matrix between 1.5.1 and 1.6.0 added.

2.0.4: (#1600)
======
# Bug Fixes:
- brought back the maximum number of items displayable on the world map to 300 (600 was causing disconnect in some cases) as a temporary fix until the world map display can be done another, meanwhile use the filters provided in the configuration dialog to see what you're interested in.
  Note that this does not resolve the basic issue (the delay itself isn't in Gatherer but in the game UI engine) but seems to make the problem not occur. Also it almost never seems to occur when you come back to the map your character is in before exiting the world map.
- a side effect of the new format will fix wandering icons on the minimap for users importing data  (could previouly be fixed by doing a zone match with same source and destination or running the RecalcNotes function which was removed since it now serves no purpose without minimap coordinates in the stored data).
- caught a few memory leaks (still plenty around though).

# Features:
* Commands:
- added /gather loginfo on/off slash command to show/hide logon information (version string is still displayed).
- added /gather filterrec slash command and corresponding checkboxes in the configuration dialog to link actual recording of nodes to the current filter content (broken down by characters and gather type).

* Database:
- Changed database format, replacing gtype and icon by indexes (saves 30-50% space depending on database content), complete conversion will only occur on using the zone match facility (same origin and destination).
- Gatherer version number added in GatherConfig.Version variable (for DB backup applications).

* Items
- New Items:
  - Un'Goro Power Crystals 
  - Un'Goro Soil
  - BloodPetal Sprouts
  - Blood of Heroes
  - Footlockers (need to unlock them before being able to record them, so this is rogue only strictly speaking)
- New set of icons for Ores and Un'Goro items (courtesy of Wt, Melina and Iriel).
- Rich Thorium now has it's own icon (a placeholder really, until someone provides something more appropriate), the change will appear immediately on the world map, change on the minimap will be visible only after using the zone match facility (same origin and destination).

* External interface
- New interface function (Gatherer_AddGather , see Gatherer.lua for parameters) for external addons to add record things in the Gatherer database.

* World Map
- World Map now has a show/hide button for items (lower left corner), It is off by default and will reset to that whenever you change zone (or miniregion), if the display is off, the delay/freeze while displaying items on the world map won't happen (if any) until you click to show the items. 
- Filters are now accessible from the world map (note that changing the on/off/auto setting from the world map will bring you back to your character's current zone map). This is off by default, to enable it, check the button in the configuration dialog.
- Interface to delete/flag node as bugged (accessible through alt-right clicking on an item, which used to delete it right away), these buttons appear on the lower right of the world map frame when available.

* Localization
- Localized clients (ie. non-english) will get a popup at startup if a version new of Gatherer is installed as a reminder to check for new zone matches), this will be enabled when appropriate.

2.0.3:
===========
* Bug Fixes:
- Localization:
  # german: error in localization.lua
- Map should show correctly in battlegrounds now.

2.0.2:
===========
* Bug Fixes:
- Localization:
  # english: barrel gathering should now read barrels that have the keyword at the beginning of the gather text
  # german: firebloom, mountain silversage, clam, rich thorium and small thorium should be fixed, "ooze covered" display problem should be fixed too.
  # french: zone transition matrix for wow patch 1.5.0 added
  # french: new french GatherRegionData ordered table
- slowdown on using no icon under min distance option should be lessened in gather item heavy environment
- delay opening world map with a huge number of items should be reasonable now.

* Features:
- Icon size on worldmap can now be changed (between 8 and 16, included, hit enter in the edit box to validate the new value)
- option to hide the minimap menu icon
- tooltips added for all UI elements
- added tooltip to menu title to make it more obvious you can click on it to access configuration dialog
- option to hide mininotes while still displaying gather items on minimap
- option to display full item name on worldmap item tooltip instead of the short one (thorium will always show the long name whatever the option value is)
- myAddOns support
- ingame item deletion facility added (alt right click on item on the worldmap), alt mousing over an item in the worldmap display full name and item indexes in the GatherItems structure.
- misc: added a hundred more buttons to display items on world map as part of the large item DB fix.

2.0.1:
======
* UI: New movable UI button on minimap border, gives access to a quick toggle menu for main filters (options for show/hide the quickmenu and move the minimap icon in the options dialog).
* UI: by clicking on the quick menu title, you access a configuration windows for Gatherer options (can also be accessed by using /gather options).
* UI: key binding available for the quickmenu.

* Filter (UI only): possibility to filter ore/herbs display by giving minimum skill level (text field next to the gather type filter boxes).
* Filter (UI only): possibility to select specific objects to display.
* Filter (UI only): couple rare ore/herbs so that they can be displayed together (ex: tin and silver shown together by selecting only one, or for herbs selection swiftthistle will show briarthorn and mageroyal)
* Filter (UI only): prevent gatherer icon from displaying when a node is closer than the min icon distance (used to switch between theme icon and item icon).

* Localization: french and german localization fixes
* Localization: facility for swapping data around zones and fixing item names for localized clients

* Various: GatherRegionTable moved to it's own file outside of Gatherer.lua

* Bug Fix: remaining RegisterForSave removed from code, in some case they could cause a fatal client error with #132 error (note: this is not specific to gatherer, it's true for all WoW addons)
* Bug Fix: missing icon for treasure in original theme fixed
* Bug Fix: Real zone text is now used that should alleviate difficulty to display the map in some zone on first try (ie. Ironforge).
